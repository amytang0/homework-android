# Eaze Android Homework

>Our Android code challenge for engineering applicants

## Project

Using the [Giphy API](https://github.com/Giphy/GiphyAPI), implement a gif search app. This assignment is intentionally left open-ended so that you can add what you believe is important and relevant. Some possible ideas include but are not limited to:
* Endless scrolling on search results
* Relevant actions upon selecting a gif
* Handling orientation changes
* Swipe-to-refresh for gif results
* Beautiful material design
* Maintain a backstack and preserve application state
* Unit tests
* Whatever you think would be beneficial!

If you do not have time to implement every feature that you think would be useful, feel free to include documentation as to what your next development steps would be.

## Structure

We've provided the basics to get you started. The starter app is located in the `app/` directory. Use the starter app if you want to get things up and running quickly. If you'd prefer to start from scratch yourself, feel free to do so. Just make sure that you provide us with instructions for running your app.
Alternately, if you would prefer to implement this app in Javascript using React Native, please feel free to do so!
