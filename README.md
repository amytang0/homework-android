# Eaze Android Homework

>Our Android code challenge for engineering applicants

## Project

Using the [Giphy API](https://github.com/Giphy/GiphyAPI), implement a gif search app. This is an open ended project so do as much or as little as you think is necessary to achieve the desired goal.

## Structure

We've provided the basics to get you started. The starter app is located in the `app/` directory. Use the starter app if you want to get things up and running quickly. If you'd prefer to start from scratch yourself, feel free to do so. Just make sure that you provide us with instructions for running your app.
